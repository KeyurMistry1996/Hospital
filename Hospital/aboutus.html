          <p>Since 1934, the General Hospital (GH) has been providing cutting‑edge treatment and compassionate care to
            patients
            from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds in Montreal, throughout Quebec and beyond. As one of the
            province’s largest and busiest acute-care hospitals, this 637‑bed McGill University teaching hospital admits
            more than 23,000 patients a year, while handling at least 300,000 outpatient visits, 67,000 emergency visits
            and more than 4,000 births on an annual basis.</p>

        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To provide patient care of the highest quality in a humane and caring manner, with an emphasis on
            specialized and ultra-specialized care</li>
          <li>To develop and promote an environment for leadership and excellence in health sciences education</li>
          <li>To encourage and support research in order to advance the knowledge of the prevention, cause and treatment
            of illness and the promotion of health</li>
          <li>To actively participate in and lead the development and evaluation of new technologies in order to enhance
            patient care</li>

        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="row mission">
        <h2>The Modern Era</h2>

        <p>At the dawn of the 21st century, the General Hospital finds itself coping once again with the rapidly
          burgeoning needs of new waves of immigrants—arriving this time from around the world. The Côte‑des‑Neiges
          neighbourhood, where the JGH is located, has become the destination for many of Montreal’s new arrivals and it
          has been transformed into one of Canada’s most ethnically and culturally diverse urban areas.</p>
        <p>This has prompted the GH to expand, upgrade and broaden its range of medical services. In 2005, in order to
          provide much‑needed space for growth, the hospital purchased six acres of adjoining land and buildings from
          Les Soeurs de Sainte-Croix, an order of nuns. This property is now in use, with the opening of a hemodialysis
          unit in 2005 and the Cardiovascular Prevention Centre in 2006. In coming years, it will serve as the site for
          various patient services, including larger and improved premises for the Emergency Department, the Intensive
          Care Unit and the Herzl Family Practice Centre.</p>
        <p>Also noteworthy was the launch in 2006 of the Segal Cancer Centre, housed in four of the eight new floors
          that were built atop an existing pavilion in the western portion of the hospital. The Segal Cancer Centre
          brings together almost all of the GH’s cancer‑related services and programs under one roof, including
          diagnosis, treatment, research, prevention and psychosocial support. In this way, the efficiency and
          effectiveness of treatment is improved, since healthcare professionals from a wide variety of fields are
          centrally located and can act quickly to provide optimum care.</p>
        <p>This multi‑disciplinary approach, especially evident at the Segal Cancer Centre, has become standard practice
          throughout the Jewish General Hospital, as teams of diverse healthcare professionals collaborate closely and
          regularly in the best interests of the patients.</p>


      </div>
      <div class="row mission">
        <h2>The Future</h2>


        <p>As the General Hospital progresses into the 21st century, its primary objective is to find innovative,
          efficient and cost‑effective ways of responding to the changing demographics and medical needs of its
          patients.</p>
        <p>One important means of doing so is through the physical expansion of existing premises (for instance,
          constructing a new Radiation Oncology facility below ground level, near the main entrance) and the extensive
          development of the neighbouring property acquired from Les Soeurs de Sainte‑Croix. All facilities, whether old
          or new, will also continue to benefit from major upgrades in digital and wireless technology. In this way, the
          JGH expects to cut waiting times while modernizing its patient services.</p>
        <p>These changes will be complemented by an ever‑increasing emphasis on teamwork and collaboration among those
          who provide treatment and care to patients. Instead of being “passed” from one healthcare professional to the
          next, the patient is treated by a co‑ordinated that includes doctors and nurses, as well as affiliated
          professionals such as pharmacists, physiotherapists, nutritionists and social workers.</p>
        <p>As the number of seniors increases with the aging of the baby-boom generation, the Jewish General Hospital is
          also placing significant emphasis on the prevention of illness. Currently, this is particularly apparent in
          the activities of the Segal Cancer Centre and the Cardiovascular Prevention Centre, where patients are
          regularly advised on strategies for maintaining good health. While the hospital’s goal is to provide the best
          possible treatment where necessary, it also strives to help patients avoid the necessity of treatment in the
          first place. Similarly, the JGH’s long‑term objective is not just to extend life expectancy, but to help
          individuals achieve a healthy and self‑sufficient lifestyle for as long as possible</p>
